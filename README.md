# Micro Sensor SIEM

The Micro Sensor SIEM is a security information and event management system designed to capture packets, process them, and provide valuable insights for network security analysis. This project focuses on monitoring network traffic, extracting relevant information from packets, and applying advanced security analysis techniques.

## Features

- Packet Capture: The system captures network packets, providing real-time visibility into network activities.

- Security Analysis: It applies various security analysis techniques to the captured packets, enabling the detection of potential threats, anomalies, and suspicious behavior.

- Granular Monitoring: Leveraging micro sensor technology, the system performs fine-grained analysis at the packet level, enhancing security monitoring capabilities.

- Event Correlation: The captured information is processed, correlated, and organized to generate meaningful security insights and alerts.
